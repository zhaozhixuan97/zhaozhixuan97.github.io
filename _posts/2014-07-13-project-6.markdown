description:I did the simulation of laser ablation graphite nozzle piece process in COMSOL by coupling the solid heat transfer module and the deformation geometry module. Heat removal was set up by evaporation in the heat transfer physical field, expressed as heat flux; and the ablation was set up by evaporation in the deformed grid physical field.
