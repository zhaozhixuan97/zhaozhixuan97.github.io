description: The cell size of THZ metamaterial was scanned and simulated by COMSOL to obtain the corresponding response wavelength of metamaterial with different shapes and geometric sizes. The simulation results are used as the input of the neural network, and then the neural network of the specified wavelength metamaterial can be trained.
